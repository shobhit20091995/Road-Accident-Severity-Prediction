# 🚗 Road Accident Severity Prediction

This repository contains a **Machine Learning model** for predicting the severity of road accidents in the United States. The project involves **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to **predict accident severity** based on various factors such as **weather conditions, location, time of day, and road features**. The dataset used is **US Accidents (March 2023)**, which contains millions of traffic accident records.

🚀 **Main Steps in the Pipeline:**
1. **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Converting categorical features to numerical  
   - Extracting time-based features (Hour, Day, Month, Weekday)  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Removing unnecessary columns  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Standardizing numerical features  

3. **Train-Validation-Test Split**  
   - **Train (75%)** | **Validation (15%)** | **Test (10%)**

4. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - **Random Forest Classifier** for accident severity prediction  
   - **Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation**

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - Identifying key factors influencing accident severity

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle:  
📌 **[US Accidents Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)**  

The dataset contains **road accident records** from across the US with features related to **location, weather, traffic signals, and accident details**.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `Severity` | Accident severity level (1-4) |
| `Start_Lat`, `Start_Lng` | Latitude & Longitude of accident |
| `Distance(mi)` | Distance impacted by accident |
| `Weather_Condition` | Weather during accident (Rain, Fog, Snow, etc.) |
| `Temperature(F)`, `Humidity(%)`, `Wind_Speed(mph)` | Weather factors |
| `Junction`, `Traffic_Signal`, `Bump` | Road conditions |
| `Hour`, `Day`, `Month`, `Weekday` | Extracted time-based features |

🚀 **The goal is to predict the `Severity` of an accident using these features.**
